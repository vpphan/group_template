    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "American football is one of the world's most popular sports, with millions of fans tuning in to see their favorite players compete in an exciting game. The National Football League, or NFL, as it is more widely known, is the most well-known American football league. The NFL season culminates with the annual Super Bowl, which attracts a large audience every year<a name=\"operationnote\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#operation). While the players on the field may be the only ones throwing or catching the ball, they are not the only ones participating in a game. As fans watch the action on the field, another form of engagement has emerged: fantasy football. Fantasy football allows football fans to create virtual teams, draft real NFL players, and compete using performance statistics. As the 2023 season has now concluded, fans are frantically analyzing player statistics to determine which players would be the best to draft for their 2024 fantasy football teams. This project aims to help fantasy football fans determine their draft picks by grouping players with similar stats. The use of AI to help fans with their fantasy football leagues is not a novel concept. Gridiron AI, a popular app, uses data analysis to help users make the best draft picks<a name=\"NFLAInote\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#NFLAI). However, unlike Gridiron AI, our project will take a more diverse approach by investigating a different statistical model and will not be locked behind a paywall. "

    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this project is to develop a K-means algorithm to predict the potential standout performers for the upcoming NFL season. The datasets we will be using for this project utilize biological features and past performance statistics of the players. This dataset will be segmented into subsets based on their positions, and K-means algorithms will be training each subset to create clusters, grouping players according to their statistics. We will generate random clusters of players based on their attributes to evaluate the performance of the K-means. We will also apply the adjusted rand score to determine if it is able to accurately cluster players based on their attributes. This prediction is measurable since we can evaluate the accuracy of the K-means’ predictions by comparing them to fantasy football standings and random predictions. The adjusted rand score provides a quantitative measure of its performance in clustering players’ statistics. Lastly, because this process can be iterated in different NFL seasons using the similar datasets and method, this is replicable."

    "# Data\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a lot of big data revolving around the NFL, so finding relevant data wasn’t hard. Although there was a lot of places to choose from, we ended up narrowing down to three data sources:\n",
    "\n",
    "**NFL Team Data 2003-2023**<a name=\"Cantalupanote\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#Cantalupa):\n",
    "This data set consists of 35 variables and 320 observations. The variables revolve around the overall yearly performance of each individual NFL team for the past 20 years. These describe features like number of wins/losses, the number of touchdowns, and average yards per play. All of the variables besides team name and year are quantitative variables that are describing either the total number of something happening (like wins and losses) or the average number of something gained/lost(like rushing yards per attempt). Because of this all of the observations, besides the name of the team, are represented by an int or float. The data is as clean as it is, so there shouldn’t be a need to do any special handling/cleaning. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**NFL Player Statistic dataset**<a name=\"Steussienote\"></a>[<sup>4</sup>](#Steussie):\n",
    "This data set is a lot bigger than the others and is divided into many different parts. We chose to focus primarily on the combine portion of the dataset. This data revolves around each individual player's biological features and athletic capabilities. The data set has 35 variables and 9814 observations. Each observation has a mix of int, floats, and strings. The variables that have strings consist of either the name of the player, name of team, name of college, position of the player, or name of home city. The other variables consist of measurements in inches(like arm length), pounds(like weight or bench press), and seconds(like 40 meter dash). Although the data is relatively clean, there will be some handling of converting the strings into some sort of number representation. We could possibly use longitude and latitude values for home city for example. We will also need to organize the data based on position. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pro-Football Reference**<a name=\"profootballnote\"></a>[<sup>5</sup>](#profootball):\n",
    "This dataset consists of multiple portions as well. We will focus on the passing, rushing, and receiving portions which have 32 variables by 104 observations, 16 variables by 346 observations, 20 variables by 482 observations respectively. The data displays the performances of each individual player per week of each season. We are currently thinking of just using the 2023 season. The observations consist of int, floats, percents and strings for the name of the player and their positions. The most critical variables consist of features like touchdowns, rushing/passing yards completed, and passing attempts. This data set is also really clean so not too much needs to be done. The percentages may need to be turned into numbers if they are represented by a string. We also need to take out outliers that skew our data. For example, we don’t need to add data from wide receivers who threw touchdowns. "

    "# Proposed Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "One potential solution to the problem of assisting fantasy football fans in making draft picks is to use a clustering algorithm to group players with similar stats. We wanted to specifically focus on using the K-means algorithm using each player’s statistical profile that can be inputted into the algorithm. We can use Python’s scikit-learn library to perform the K-means clustering. After the clusters are created, fantasy football fans can use the clusters to create their draft picks. For example, if two players are in the same cluster, it indicates that they have similar statistical profiles and may be interchangeable in fantasy value. If a player is selected, team owners can use the clusters to look for players who are statistically similar to the first player. We intended to evaluate our model's accuracy by looking at the adjusted rand score. We also intended to compare the outcomes of our model with the actual 2023 fantasy football league player performance (according to ESPN)<a name=\"ESPNnote\"></a>[<sup>6</sup>](#ESPN).  "

    "# Evaluation Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that we wanted to cluster our dataset using the K-means algorithm to look at the different statistics of Football players of the 2023 NFL season, the evaluation metric we wanted to focus on was assessing the cluster qualities we have and see how well the algorithm fits our data in proper clusters. In addition, we wanted to focus on being able to interpret the results well given the different clusters. \n",
    "One of the evaluation metrics we wanted to focus on is the adjusted rand score, which compares the similarities between the predicted clusters the data is put into versus the actual clusters they belong to. The adjusted random index also takes into account the possibility of chance, making it more accurate as a measure than the random index. The adjusted random index is calculated by: ARI = (RI - Expected_RI) / (max(RI) - Expected_RI). However, given that there is no accurate way to say which actual cluster the datasets belong to other than our human eye judgment, we also wanted to use other evaluation metrics.\n",
    "Another evaluation metric we wanted to look at was the Elbow graphing method as well, a way to find the optimal K value for our K-means algorithm. This method graphs the Within-Cluster Sum of Squares, which really just gets the sum of the square distances between the points in the cluster and the cluster center. Then, we can look at the graph and see where the WCSS value starts to flatten out as the number of clusters increases."

    "Reports should have a __narrative__. Once you've looked through all your results over the quarter, decide on one main point and 2-4 secondary points you want us to understand. Include the detailed code and analysis results of those points only; you should spend more time/code/plots on your main point than the others.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you went down any blind alleys that you later decided to not pursue, please don't abuse the TAs time by throwing in 81 lines of code and 4 plots related to something you actually abandoned.  Consider deleting things that are not important to your narrative.  If its slightly relevant to the narrative or you just want us to know you tried something, you could keep it in by summarizing the result in this report in a sentence or two, moving the actual analysis to another file in your repo, and providing us a link to that file.\n",

Think clearly about your results, decide on one main point and 2-4 secondary points you want us to understand. Highlight HOW your results support those points.  You probably want 2-5 sentences per point.\n",

    "### Ethics & Privacy\n",
    "\n",
    "- The data files that our group used are publicly available on Kaggle and Pro Football Reference, which are publicly accessible sites.\n",
    "- The players’ information and contracts are also available publicly online. Their contracts cannot be kept private due to the league to enforce salary cap requirements. \n",
    "- The potential bias that may have occurred when collecting the data:\n",
    "    - Players who have fame or recognition are typically expected to maintain a high level of proficiency.\n",
    "    - Players who newly joined the league typically characterized by lower salaries, also often viewed as still developing their skills.\n",
    "    - Players with high salaries are expected to justify their compensation through high quality on-field contributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Reiterate your main point and in just a few sentences tell us how your results support it. Mention how this work would fit in the background/context of other work in this field if you can. Suggest directions for future work if you want to."
